A responsive email subscription landing page built with React + Tailwind CSS, featuring client-side form validation and comprehensive component testing.

Created as part of the building challenges from **[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)**.

---

## Overview

This is my first project that uses a modern **[React](https://react.dev)** + **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)** implementation completing Frontend Mentor's **[Base Apparel Coming Soon challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/base-apparel-coming-soon-page-5d46b47f8db8a7063f9331a0)**.

The focus of this project was placed on form behavior, user experience, accessibility, and testing beyond layout and styling,

---

## Features

- Controlled email input with client-side validation using **[React](https://react.dev)**
- Responsive layout optimized for mobile and desktop using **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)**
- Error handling triggered on meaningful user interactions
- Accessible form markup with semantic HTML
- Keyboard-friendly focus management
- Component-level tests using **[Vitest](https://vitest.dev)** and **[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com)**
- Production deployment with performance auditing
- Light and dark mode support

## Development Workflow

[![Network Graph](public/img/network-graph.png)](https://github.com/CodingWithJiro/frontend-mentor-base-apparel-coming-soon/network)

> Click to view the full branch and merge history

This project adapts a **[granular branching and commit workflow](https://github.com/CodingWithJiro/frontend-mentor-base-apparel-coming-soon/network)** to simulate team collaboration. Each feature, fix, documentation, and chore is tracked in its own branch with descriptive commits.

Each **[pull request](REPO_PULL_REQUEST_CLOSED_LINK)** I created contains a clear description, change list, screenshots for UI updates, and reviewer notes.

_This ensures I maintain a professional workflow, even as a solo developer._

## What I Learned

- Installing the project dependencies such as React and Tailwind CSS libraries
- Familiarized myself into the initial scaffolding of a Vite + React project
- Gained experience on tweaking config files
- Managing form state and validation using React hooks
- Using `onFocus` and `onBlur` correctly to improve UX
- Translating native browser focus behavior into predictable React logic
- First time writing user-centric tests with **[Vitest](https://vitest.dev)** and **[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com)**
- Avoiding brittle tests by testing behavior instead of implementation
- Applying Tailwind utility classes for interactive and accessible states
